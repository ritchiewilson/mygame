Starship Commander (not Galaga) User Manual

Gala... Starship Commander has two main aspects to its control:
	-The control pad: up, down, left, and right, control the movement of the ship.
		- The ship can move anywhere so long as it does not come into contact with 
			aliens and it stays within the game boundaries.
	- The space bar controls the only weapon of the ship, your bomb. 
		- Only one bomb can be fired at a time, and a second bomb cannot be fired 
			until the first one disappears.
		- Once the bomb is released from the ship, it will travel forward for 10 ticks 
			before exploding outward. The explosion lasts 6 ticks, after which a new 
			bomb can be launched. Be careful, as you are vulnerable during your reload.

The objective of the game:
	- Stay alive!
		- Avoid direct contact with the aliens, doing so will cause you to die. 
	- Defeat the alien invaders!
		- You and your ship are humanities' last hope. The future of all mankind rests
			on your shoulders. Make us proud. 
			
Your score is visible in the bottom right corner of the screen, and keeps track of
	how many aliens you have destroyed in your current game.
